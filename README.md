Our dataset is collected from a large study performed by the CDC yearly, where they interviewed over 400,000 individuals over the phone, asking about their general well-being, health issues, drug and alcohol use, and physical statistics.  
We will use this data to attempt to answer the following questions:

1. Is there a correlation between 'Taking Mental Health Days' and 'General Health Overall'?
Answer: My analysis found that on average, from ~89k individuals, the worse ones' health gets, the more mental health days you can expect them to take. Individuals with excellent health took just over two mental health days, while those with poor health took over 13. An R-value of .95 suggests a very high correlation between the two variables.
I wanted to ensure that the dataset was not skewed in one direction. If we had very little data for any health group, especially the top and bottom groups, then it would be a concern, and the result would need further validation. I found sufficient representation from all groups, although most of the sample was healthier. The data source could explain this, as certain states and cities are healthier. I am validating my initial findings by looking at the percentage of total mental health days taken by group. The results supported the initial findings. The excellent and very good health groups comprise over 50% of the sample group but comprise ~32% of the mental health days taken. Conversely, individuals with poor and fair health make up ~17% of the sample group but makeup ~36% of the mental health days taken. One surprising observation is that the Good health group had almost the same percentage between the two charts. I’m not positive what this suggests.
Last, I looked at the same problem through a different lens. Categorizing health into five buckets is likely oversimplifying a complex measurement. Also, the buckets being used could be qualitative measurements instead of being based on hard data. Therefore, I wanted to do the same analysis but use a different way of categorizing “health.” I used BMI this time, which still has flaws but is quantitative. The results were far less conclusive. There was a correlation with an R-value of .08, but it’s very weak. This analysis also surfaced some potential shortfalls with the data. The obvious one is the large data grouping on increments of 5 days. This suggests that people might be using mental health days not because they need them for mental health reasons but because they are given a certain amount of these days by their employer and use them as vacation days. This last analysis makes me less confident in my initial findings and suggests other factors at play.

2. Are E-cigarettes better or worse for your health compared to regular smoking?
Answer: We used data on General Health along with whether an individual used ECigerettes or smoked to draw our conclusions.  Comparing pie charts generated by the two datasets, the findings suggest that between current smokers and e-cigarette users, e-cigarette users reported better perceptions of their health, with a lower percentage in the "Poor" health category (2.5%).  Also, Non-smokers using e-cigarettes demonstrated a more balanced health distribution but had a higher rate of "Poor" and "Fair" health ratings. This may indicate that e-cigarettes are less harmful than regular smoking for current smokers. However, for non-smokers, e-cigarette use may introduce risks without clear health benefits. The data highlights several critical insights, including that E-cigarettes may be a less harmful alternative for current smokers looking to reduce harm or quit smoking. Also, Non-smokers using e-cigarettes do not report significantly better health outcomes and may face risks that outweigh the benefits.
However, these observations are based on self-reported health perceptions, not medical assessments. Additional factors—such as pre-existing health conditions, age, lifestyle, and frequency of e-cigarette use—could influence the results. The data reflects how individuals feel about their health, not medical diagnoses or long-term outcomes. Additionally, further research is needed to assess the broader, long-term impacts of e-cigarette use.  These are the limitations of the dataset.  Ultimately, we can conclude that E-cigarettes may play a role in harm reduction for smokers, but their safety and efficacy for non-smokers remain questionable.

3. Is more sleep an indicator of better overall health? (Chronic conditions, such as BMI and conditions of good health)
Answer: Based on the data, a clear correlation exists between hours slept per day and general health score.  More hours slept will provide a better health score.  According to a linear regression model with an R squared value of 0.97 (so, a very good fit to the data), an average of 0.13 hours (about 8 minutes) will increase your health score (1=Poor, 2=Fair, 3=Good, 4=Very Good, 5=Excellent) by one value.  There could be some underlying noise contributing to this.  It's possible that people with a worse health situation could have sleep apnea or health issues that cause them to get less sleep than a perfectly healthy person.  
Additionally, a similar trend is seen when comparing the average number of people who sleep nine hours per day to those who sleep five hours per day. In the nine-hour population, 16.6% of people claim to be in Excellent health, while only 4.1% claim to be in poor health. The numbers for the five-hour population are 11.0% and 8.7%, respectively.  
Thus, it can be concluded that a great amount of sleep, on average, will correlate to better health overall.
 
4. What are the healthiest and least healthiest states?
Answer: Based on BMI, the five healthiest states are (from 5-1) Massachusetts, Vermont, California, Colorado, and Hawaii.  The average BMI of a Hawaiian person checks in at 26.84.  The five least healthiest states are (from 46-50) Alabama, Ohio, Kentucky, Mississippi, and West Virginia.  The average West Virginian has a BMI of 29.82.  Based on the percentage of the population that claims to do physical activity daily, Colorado is the most healthy, with 84.78% of the population. Mississippi is the worst, with 68.68% responding 'yes.'  Colorado and Vermont were in the top 5 in both results, and Mississippi and West Virginia were in the bottom 5 in both results, drawing a pretty clear top 2 healthy states and bottom 2 unhealthy states.  

5. Is there a correlation between depressive disorders and BMI? (high or low)
Answer: We filtered the data to remove rows of incomplete data and columns of irrelevant data.  We then categorized the BMI values into groups for analysis (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese).  Histograms were then used to illustrate the BMI distribution for individuals with and without depressive disorders, and a Chi-Square test was used to evaluate the relationship between BMI categories and depressive disorders.  The Chi-Square statistic and p-value determine the significance of the observed relationship.  
The analysis identifies significant patterns and relationships between BMI categories and the prevalence of depressive disorders.  Key insights are derived from statistical and visual evidence provided in the notebook.
